# weather-app

For an upcoming project I'm interested in building (a custom magic mirror) I wanted to familiarize myself with [OpenWeatherMap's](https://openweathermap.org) forecasting APIs and continue to work on my Javascript / CSS skills. So I decided to build a simple desktop web-app capable of searching for locations and displaying the corresponding weather data. This project leveraged two of OpenWeatherMap's APIs available for free trials. The first was the Geocoding [API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api), which I used to convert user entered locations into Latitude and Longitude coordinates. With the coordinates in hand, it is then a simple exercise to retrieve the current and forecasted weather conditions with One Call [API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3).
